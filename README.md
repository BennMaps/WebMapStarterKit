## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This excercise will ultimately be a part of the talk I'm preparing for Practical Cartography Day at NACIS 2024 in Tacoma.

Here's the Abstract: 

> Ever wondered how you can create custom web maps for your portfolio, passion project, or job WITHOUT setting up a tile server, web server, or cloud services account? Hoping to do it without too much coding or cost? Got some maps you made and just want to display with a little bit of interactivity? This talk will walk you quickly through what you need to do to create and show interactive web maps serverlessly with PMtiles, Protomaps JS, and MapLibre.

This work is informed by ongoing efforts to rehab old portfolio pieces of mine (see [this repo](https://github.com/mizmay/RentAffordability) for example). I'm undertaking it because I think converting GIS projects to portfolio pieces *as web maps* should be easier!

Follow these steps to help test my theory:
1. Clone this repo to your personal computer or Github account
2. Get the example working via Github Pages from your own account
3. Get the example working locally via your personal computer
4. Swap out the data with your own PMTiles archive (and interactivity layer)
5. Edit the reference map layers via the stylesheet
6. File a PR to share your map back to the projects page [ WIP ]
